    # Have to get back to this org! /org/
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "Authenticated user" role

    Then I should see "Behat EDITED Test Discussion Title"


    # Same scenario, does org alias fail?

    # And I am on "/group/95/resources#Communication"
    # When I press the "btn btn-primary btn-small pull-right" button

    # has more reqs than drupal ... not sure though, maybe this old test
    # never worked. "Notice: Undefined property: stdClass::$mail"
